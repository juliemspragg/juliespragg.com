description: The Atypic team worked together to create a dynamic and user friendly website using existing design principles for Cluck. This included transporting files and information from their existing stand-alone site to Atypicâ€™s dynamic CMS. While employed at Atypic, I also assisted in training the client on how to implement changes to the site as well as how to navigate the CMS. I learned about site optimization when serving large images as well as more experience connecting the back-end CMS with the front-end elements.
