description: Working with the project manager in conjunction with the client and various team members at Atypic, I assisted in transferring SEM’s site over to Atypic’s custom CMS. This meant performing thorough QA testing and debugging throughout the site as well as ensuring that responsive design principles were met. We also implemented a few design changes as well as new page layouts, search features, and a blog.  My supervisor also allowed me to lead training and overview sessions with the client via WebEx. This experience gave me hands-on interaction on various sides of a project, from client relations to coding in a real-world scenario.
