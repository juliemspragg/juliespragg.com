            	<p>Hi! I'm Julie and I love taking photos. I started on old film cameras as a child, and continued to pick up and pursue photography into adulthood. I love natural light photography, especially that golden hour, and capturing the uniqueness and beauty in the ordinary. As a photographer, I believe that photos let us capture a moment in time. Saving a little bit of a special moment to look back on later in life.</p>
				<p>My portfolio currently consists of a great deal of random photos. There are photos I have taken for personal portrait sessions to ones of my dogs and dinner. Each of these required planning, setting up, and editing the shot. I strive to take clear, natural photos that capture the beauty in each shot. If you're interested in a shoot, please use the <a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">contact form</a> below.</p>
