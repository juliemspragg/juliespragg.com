description: My husband spent part of his childhood in Papua New Guinea. He told me about things they used to eat, and one treat they would get were these candy bars called Violet Crumbles. They're like honeycomb covered in chocolate. After searching around our home, I discovered they're no longer sold around here.  

description2: So, I set out to make them. After jumping from recipe to recipe, I discovered I had all the ingredients on hand. Corn syrup, honey, sugar, baking soda.  Milk chocolate and some white chocolate were a necessity, of course. 

recipe: <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5674/22647187179_1e2991f282_z.jpg"/><br/><br/>The basics of this recipe are to line a 9x13 pan with wax paper or aluminum foil. Do you want to never get the candy out of the dish? Remember that step.  Combine honey, corn syrup, and sugar in a pot and make it a BIG pot. It will quadruple in size. Make sure there are no dry patches of sugar. High heat until the mixture reaches 300 degrees. DO NOT STIR. It will be a light amber color. After it's reached 300 degrees, remove from heat and add in the baking soda and whisk like your life depended on it.  Science happens. Pour into pan and let it cool. Break apart and dip in chocolate. <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/659/22647171439_e6aa752e82_z.jpg"/> <br/><br/>
