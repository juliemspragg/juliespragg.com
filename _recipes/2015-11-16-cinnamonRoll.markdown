description: I had heard of these and even caught them on the Food Network. So, for our first wedding anniversary, I thought I'd make a fancy breakfast. Enter:<a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/overnight-cinnamon-rolls-recipe.html" target="_blank"> Alton Brown's Overnight Cinnamon Rolls</a>.

description2: This is definitely not an easy recipe. It requires yeast, letting things rise, and confidence. I think I watched the video of how to make these a few hundred times. 

recipe: <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/633/22390074544_e448ab5f4e_z.jpg"/><br/><br/>The basics of this recipe includes mixing the ingredients and kneading for a while. Getting the dough just right, then letting it rise/double in volume for over 2 hours. After that, rolling out the dough, spreading the cinnamon mixture, and creating your roll. After slicing, you refrigerate for up to 16 hours and bake them the next morning. <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5709/22986799216_c9f99e173d_z.jpg"/> <br/><br/>
