description: Fun at the farm, and various places in the US. I have always had an interest in animals, and constantly find myself around them. The cows pictures were taken while visiting my in-laws in Virginia, while the two dogs you see in the gallery are our pets. What can I say, animals are a great and usually cooperative subject.
